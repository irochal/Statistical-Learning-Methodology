# Statistical-Learning-Methodology
## Project 
In this project, I analysed the BreastCancer data set which concerns characteristics of breast
tissue samples collected from 699 women in Wisconsin using fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).
This is a type of biopsy procedure in which a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal appearing breast tissue. 
Nine easily-assessed cytological characteristics, such as uniformity of cell
size and shape, were measured for each tissue sample on a one to ten scale. Smaller numbers
indicate cells that looked healthier in terms of that characteristic. Further histological examination
established whether each of the samples was benign or malignant. The objective of the clinical
experiment was to determine the extent to which a tissue sample could be classified as benign or
malignant using only the nine cytological characteristics.
For the purposes of this project, I assumed that the patients can be regarded as a random
sample from the population of women experiencing symptoms of breast cancer.

The goal of the project was to build a classifier for the Class – benign or malignant – of a tissue sample based
on (at least some of) the nine cytological characteristics. What was required was evidence of an understanding
of the main statistical ideas, sound interpretation of results, sensible and reasoned comparisons of
classifiers, and demonstration of competence in the use of R as a tool for data analysis.

## Summative 
The data for this project are from 40 tissue samples, with measurements on 1,000 genes.
The first 20 samples are from healthy patients, while the second 20 are from a diseased group.
